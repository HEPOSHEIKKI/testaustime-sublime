# Testaustime for Sublime Text

This is an extension for Sublime Text that allows you to track your time spent coding using [testaustime](https://github.com/Testaustime).


## Installation

Install testaustime-sublime by hand on Linux:

```
  git clone https://github.com/HEPOSHEIKKI/testaustime-sublime.git
  zip testaustime.sublime-package testaustime-sublime/* -
  mv testaustime.sublime-package ~/.config/sublime-text/Installed\ Packages/
```
There is a pre-packaged version of the plugin bundled with each release, if downloaded this way, please skip the two first steps of the installation process.

#### Note

This is still a work in progress and my ~3rd time coding in python so all kinds of constructive critisism and [PR](https://github.com/HEPOSHEIKKI/testaustime-sublime/compare)'s are welcome.
